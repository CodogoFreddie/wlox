# wlox

A [wren](https://www.wren.io) implementation of both [jlox](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) and [clox](http://craftinginterpreters.com/)

This implementation follows the progress of the book [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/), rather than trying to port the whole thing at once, mainly because I don't have much free time
