# wlox

__Not dead, I'm just really busy right now__
A [wren](wren) implementation of both [jlox](lox) and [clox](lox)

This implementation follows the progress of the book [Crafting Interpreters](lox), rather than trying to port the whole thing at once, mainly because I don't have much free time.

Currently at section `4.6`

I'm trying to make the code less javic, and more wren-esq, but I won't get it right the first time: PRs, Issues, suggestions welcome.
